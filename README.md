# Connect4

## Overview

This is a web-based implementation of the classic Connect 4 game. The game is designed for one player to compete against the computer. The goal is to connect four of your pieces in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does.

## Features

- **Single-Player Mode**: Play against a challenging computer opponent with a basic AI.
- **Modern UI**: Bright, colorful design with a sleek, modern look. The game board resembles the classic Connect 4 blue easel, with red and yellow pieces.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is playable on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Scorekeeping**: Tracks and displays the number of games won by the player and the computer.
- **Animated Gameplay**: Smooth transitions and hover effects enhance the user experience.

## How to Play

1. **Starting the Game**: When you load the game, you will start as the red player. Your goal is to drop your pieces into the columns, trying to connect four in a row before the computer does.

2. **Making a Move**: Click on any column to drop your piece into that column. The piece will fall to the lowest available row in that column.

3. **Computer's Turn**: After you make a move, the computer will automatically take its turn, placing a yellow piece on the board.

4. **Winning the Game**: The first player to connect four pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If the board is filled without a winner, the game ends in a tie.

5. **Restarting the Game**: If a game ends, you can click the "Restart Game" button to play again. The scores will be updated automatically.
